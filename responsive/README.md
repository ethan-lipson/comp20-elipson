The css file responsive.css appropriately changes the piece of the image according to the size of the window. It does this by centering on the appropriate section of the sprite sheet.
I did not work with anyone. I used the two pages included in the spec for reference on syntax. I also looked at a w3schools tutorial for reference on moving horizontally. (Find @ https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_image_sprites.asp). I did my coding next to Maggie Van Scoy an IR/Econ major who has never coded before.

I spent approximately an hour coding it. I spent another chunk of time reading and researching it though as well as making my files (maybe 30mins).
