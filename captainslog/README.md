1)	The program reads the data and stores on hit of enter. It prints in 
reverse order of however the storage is saved, sometimes the print is the 
most recent sometimes it is prints in the middle. It does not print time.

2)	I used the code that you created and posted in the examples as well as 
stack overflow.

3) I spent maybe an hour trying to iron out the logic and kinks.

4) This project is the victim of my comp15 trie blowing my brain and creative
energy into 1000 sad jigsaw puzzle pieces.

5) Thank you,
