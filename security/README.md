README for Assignment 4

1)
The web page properly demonstrates my learning and research from hacking. It has CSS and JQuery elements.

I successfully broke the web app in multiple ways, and through various routes. I properly XSS through the playing of the game as well as through regular curl data injections. I also executed a SQL injection via querystring. I worked on breaking my own program to find where a good amount of vulnerabilities were hiding. Then I checked them against your code blindly. After that I searched through your code to try to find weaknesses. 

2)
I worked with Alex Ratzan to help him learn how to break my code.
I worked with Miko Hadeshian and Mike Pine for a breif moment on ideas for curl injections.
I spoke with Tony Goss about ideas for clearing databases via XSS
I spoke with Connor Walsh for syntax help with SQL injections.
I offhandedly asked my Comp 15 TA, Michelle Luo what type of attacks she suggest I try.
I used Stackoverflow and W3School for help with syntax. 
Finally I read the data returned when I made injections to see how previous injections were done.

3) 
I spent approximately 8-10 hours working on this project.

Thank you for an awesome semester Ming!!
