1. The program accurately changes lyrics with the video.
The program also has a linked style sheet that makes the page seem extra Simpson-y.
It pulls from the html in proper DOM format. 

2. I did not work with anyone on this lab.

3. I spent approximately 2 hours on this but a significant amount of that was trying 
to parse the source code of the Simpsons web page to get the perfect colors and font.

It looks pretty cool although I was bummed to realize that my code is rather the same
in structure to the example. Is there another way to have implemented the code?
