Ethan Lipson Comp 20 Repository

1) This repository holds web projects that do anything from load a simple bio page 
	to accessing multiple APIs to make a web app to making a server for a high scores
	web app.

2) My favorite assignment was Assignment 2. It felt incredible to watch your progress
	as you go from a blank page to a map to a plotted map to a map that has data from
	the mbta API.

3) I have grown tremendously since day one. I am no longer as naive about the dangers
	of unprotected websites as well as how simple building a web app is. I had zero
	knowledge of the difficulties of working with a group or with open source code.

4) The most important thing I learned is to look for help.
	This is clear with searching the internet to find how to implement some tech.
	It also comes from finding that a lot of my friends had already struggled and
	could help me if I asked.
	Asking for help is also helpful to avoid reinventing the wheel.

5) I am really interested in the interface level and designing web pages that look
	good and work easily for the public.
